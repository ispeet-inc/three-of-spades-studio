# Three of Spades - Premium UI Redesign Plan with Game Logic Integration

## Technical Integration Strategy

### Redux State Connection
```typescript
// Current GameRedux.tsx transformation (enhance this):
const transformedGameState = {
  players: Object.entries(gameState.players).map(([index, player]) => ({
    id: `player-${index}`,
    name: gameState.playerNames[parseInt(index)],
    team: gameState.playerTeamMap?.[parseInt(index)] === 0 ? 1 : 2,
    cards: player.hand,  // REAL CARDS FROM REDUX
    isCurrentPlayer: parseInt(index) === gameState.turn,
    isTeammate: /* real teammate logic */
  })),
  currentTrick: gameState.tableCards,  // REAL TRICK CARDS
  trumpSuit: /* convert gameState.trumpSuite number to string */,
  currentBid: gameState.bidAmount,  // REAL BID
  teamScores: { 
    team1: gameState.scores[0],  // REAL SCORES
    team2: gameState.scores[1] 
  }
};
```

### Component Architecture (Enhanced)
